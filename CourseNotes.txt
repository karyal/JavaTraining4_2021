- Declare variable
- Value Assign
- Value Access (print())
- Type Conversion (byte to short)

- Memory Consumption by Data Type - byte ? (byte, kilobyte, megabyte) how much? - HW [June-15 2021]

- Local variable - declared inside of function (main())
- Global variable - declared outside of function (main()). global variable shuld be static in nature; because main function is static

- Pointers in C/C++ Programming - Revised : Memory Address Accessing of System

Day-3
- string
- Object
- Memory Size - Chart
- Varaible Decalre, Memory Allocate, Memory Access (hashCode()/C, C++ Pinters - Revised)

- Type Conversion (Numeric to String/String to Numeric)

Day-4
- Conversion - boolean, char 
- Character Encoding
	- ASCII Value : Research
	- Unicode Value : Research

- Keyboard -> String -> Program (Accept) -> String -> Cast/Conversion -> Specific Type -> Process -> Result -> Cast/Conversion -> String -> User

- Basic IO - Input/Output (Input from Keyboard/Display on Screen)
	- Numeric to String/String to Numeric
	
	- Input
		- Keyboard, Scanner, Mouse, Microphone, File, Dabase, Network
		- Keyboard - Default Media of Input
		- Read value from Keyboard and Assign to Variable 
			- Scanner Class - System Defined Class
			- We can consume/use this class to read value from keyboard
			- How to read value from keyboard
			- How to convert string to specific type
	
	- Accept two numbers, display sum, difference, product, division, remainder of them. HW
