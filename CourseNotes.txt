Day-2 [Tuesday June 15, 2021]
- Data Types	Possible Value

a. boolean 		ture/false
- Yes/No, Pass/Fail, True/False, On/Off, 
b. byte			Numeric value - whole number (without fractional value) [127 to -128]
c. short		Numeric value - whole number (without fractional value) [32767 to -32768]
d. int			Numeric value - whole number (without fractional value) [2147483647 to -2147483648]

j. Object 		Global type which can store any type of value.


- Declare variable
- Value Assign
- Value Access (print())
- Type Conversion (byte to short)

- Memory Consumption by Data Type - byte ? (byte, kilobyte, megabyte) how much? - HW [June-15 2021]

- Local variable - declared inside of function (main())
- Global variable - declared outside of function (main()). global variable shuld be static in nature; because main function is static

- Pointers in C/C++ Programming - Revised : Memory Address Accessing of System

Day-3
- string
- Object
- Memory Size - Chart
- Varaible Decalre, Memory Allocate, Memory Access (hashCode()/C, C++ Pinters - Revised)
- Type Casting and Type Conversion
- Type Casting (Numeric to Numeric - Auto Conversion/Casting)
- Type Conversion (Numeric to String/String to Numeric)

Day-4
- Conversion - boolean, char 
- Character Encoding
	- ASCII Value : Research
	- Unicode Value : Research

- Keyboard -> String -> Program (Accept) -> String -> Cast/Conversion -> Specific Type -> Process -> Result -> Cast/Conversion -> String -> User

- Basic IO - Input/Output (Input from Keyboard/Display on Screen)
	- Numeric to String/String to Numeric
	
	- Input
		- Keyboard, Scanner, Mouse, Microphone, File, Dabase, Network
		- Keyboard - Default Media of Input
		- Read value from Keyboard and Assign to Variable 
			- Scanner Class - System Defined Class
			- We can consume/use this class to read value from keyboard
			- How to read value from keyboard
			- How to convert string to specific type
	
	- Accept two numbers, display sum, difference, product, division, remainder of them. HW

Day-5
- Input/Output - V2

- Operators in Java
	- Arthematic Operators (+, -, *, /, %, pow, sqrt, ++(increment), --(decrement))
	- Assignment Operators

Day-6	
	- Relational Operators (==, !=, >, >=, <, <=)
	- Compare two values and generate boolean result (true/false)
	- Compare two values - Condition -> boolean
	- We takes decision based on result
	- Specially working with Numeric Types (byte, short, int, long, float, double, char)
	- boolean type (==, !=)
	- String (Not Applicable)
	
	- Greater than (>) or Equals to (==) (>=)
	
	- Truth table of OR and AND
	- (Condition1) or (Condition2)
	  (num1 > num2) or (num1 == num2)
	  True          or  True          -> True 
	  True          or  False         -> True 
	  False         or  True          -> True 
	  False         or  False         -> False 
	
	- (Condition1) and (Condition2)
	  (num1 > num2) and (num1 == num2)
	  True          and  True          -> True 
	  True          and  False         -> False 
	  False         and  True          -> False 
	  False         and  False         -> False 
	  
	- Lesst than or equals to (<=) (<) or (==)
	
	- Logical Operators
	- && AND, || OR , ! NOT
	
	- Conditional Operators
	(Condition)?Result1: Result2
	
	- Other Operators
	{}, [], (), . , ;
	
	
	- Bitwise Operators (Lowlevel Operators)

Day-7
